# Versioning System

This project implements a stateless versioning system that generates changelogs
dynamically during CI/CD builds without committing `CHANGELOG.md` to git.

## Overview

The versioning system is designed to be:

- **Stateless**: No version files are committed to git
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Changelogs are generated during builds
- **Conventional**: Uses conventional commits for automatic versioning
- **Dynamic**: Version information is computed from git history
- **Reusable**: Can be used across multiple projects

## Available Commands

```bash
# Check current version
pnpm version:current

# Bump to next patch version
pnpm version:next

# Generate changelog and update version
pnpm version:release

# CLI commands
npx @dataroadinc/versioning current-version
npx @dataroadinc/versioning next-patch-version
npx @dataroadinc/versioning generate-changelog
npx @dataroadinc/versioning update-package-version

```

## How It Works

### Version Detection

The system determines the current version by:

1. Looking for the latest git tag matching the pattern `v*.*.*`
2. If no tag exists, it defaults to `0.0.0`
3. The version is automatically updated in `package.json`

### Changelog Generation

Changelogs are generated by:

1. Analyzing git commits since the last version tag
2. Grouping commits by conventional commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
3. Organizing changes by scope (project, types, etc.)
4. Including commit hashes and links to GitHub
5. Excluding certain commit types (fix, chore, refactor) by default

### Version Bumping

- **`version:current`**: Updates `package.json` with the current version from
  git tags
- **`version:next`**: Bumps the patch version (e.g., `0.0.1` â†’ `0.0.2`)
- **`version:release`**: Generates changelog and updates to current version

## Git Tags

Version tags follow the semantic versioning format:

- `v0.0.1` - Initial release
- `v0.0.2` - Patch release
- `v0.1.0` - Minor release
- `v1.0.0` - Major release

## Conventional Commits

The system uses conventional commits for automatic categorization:

```

feat(scope): add new feature
fix(scope): fix a bug
docs(scope): update documentation
style(scope): formatting changes
refactor(scope): code refactoring
test(scope): add or update tests
chore(scope): maintenance tasks

```

### Commit Type Labels

The changelog generator uses predefined labels for commit types:

```typescript
const TYPE_LABELS = {
  feat: "Features",
  docs: "Documentation",
  content: "Content",
  partners: "Partners",
  test: "Tests",
  build: "Build System",
  deps: "Dependencies",
  style: "Style",
  perf: "Performance",
}
```

### Ignored Commit Types

The following commit types are automatically excluded from changelog generation:

- `fix` - Bug fixes (typically handled by your release automation)
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor` - Code refactoring

## Version Calculation Logic

- **All Branches**: Versions follow the pattern `base+count` (e.g., `1.0.0+5`)
- **No Branch Names**: Branch names are no longer included in version numbers
- **Build Metadata**: The `+count` represents commits since the last tag
- **No Tags**: If no git tags exist, falls back to `package.json` version
- **Patch Increment**: `getNextPatchVersion()` always increments the patch
  number
- **Clean Semver**: All versions are valid semantic versioning format

## CI/CD Integration

### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

The release workflow handles formal releases with the following sequence:

1. **Build project** - Ensures all files are compiled
2. **Get next patch version** - Determines the new version number
3. **Create and push tag** - Creates git tag (e.g., `v0.0.2`)
4. **Update package.json version** - Uses `pnpm version:current` with new tag
5. **Rebuild with new version** - Ensures code uses updated version
6. **Generate changelog** - Creates changelog with correct version info
7. **Publish to NPM** - Publishes package with correct version
8. **Create GitHub Release** - Creates release with changelog

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

The CI workflow handles continuous integration builds:

1. **Build project** - Compiles TypeScript
2. **Update package.json version** - Uses `pnpm version:current` for build
   metadata
3. **Publish to NPM** - Publishes with version like `0.0.1+5`

### Key Differences

- **Release Workflow**: Creates tags, generates changelogs, formal releases
- **CI Workflow**: Build metadata only, no tags, continuous publishing
- **Version Format**: Release uses `0.0.2`, CI uses `0.0.1+5`

### Important Notes

- **Build Step Required**: Version commands need built files in `dist/`
  directory
- **Version Order**: `pnpm version:current` must run after tag creation in
  release workflow
- **Clean Versions**: All versions are valid semver format without branch names
- **NPM Publishing**: Both workflows publish to npmjs.org with correct versions

## Benefits

- **No Version Conflicts**: No manual version file management
- **Automatic Changelogs**: Generated from commit history
- **CI/CD Ready**: Works seamlessly with automated deployments
- **Conventional**: Follows industry standards
- **Stateless**: No version state in repository
- **Reusable**: Can be used across multiple projects

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Make changes and commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat(api): add new endpoint"

# Bump version for release
pnpm version:release

# The system will:
# 1. Generate CHANGELOG.md from commits since last tag
# 2. Update package.json with current version
# 3. Create git tag for the new version

```

## File Structure Assumptions

- **Package.json**: Must exist in the current working directory
- **Git Repository**: Must be a git repository with proper history
- **Working Directory**: All operations assume they're run from the project root

## Changelog Format

Generated changelogs follow this structure:

```markdown
# Changelog

## v1.0.1 (2024-01-15)
