# Git Commit Everything

- Carefully create a series of commits.
- Do not do a git push.
- Do not ever use `--no-verify` options.
- Keep using `git status` until you see that there is nothing else to commit.
- Use `git diff` to find out what's changed.
- Refer to `git-rules.mdc` for everything else.
- Do not ask any questions or approvals, just do it.
- Never assume that you can decide to commit everything yourself after 
  this explicitly specified command.
- To avoid issues during commits, read the file commitlint.config.js first.
- Do not ever assume you're done if your last command was not "git status".
