# Rules for executing commands

## CRITICAL: FORBIDDEN COMMANDS

- NEVER run `pnpm dev` - The dev server is ALWAYS already running at port 3000
- NEVER run `npm dev`, `yarn dev`, `next dev`, or any other dev server variant
- NEVER run `git commit` unless explicitly requested with exact words "please commit"
- NEVER run `git push` under ANY circumstances
- NEVER run any command with `--no-verify` flag

## IMPORTANT: Before executing ANY command, you MUST:

1. Check this list of forbidden commands
2. Assume dev server is already running
3. Use read-only commands to check status instead of starting processes
